IOHprofiler: A Benchmarking and Profiling Tool for Iterative Optimization Heuristics
============================================

IOHprofiler is a new tool for analyzing and comparing iterative optimization heuristics.
Given as input algorithms and problems written in C, C++, or Python*, it provides as output an in-depth statistical evaluation of the algorithmsâ€™ fixed-target and fixed-budget running time distributions. In addition to these performance evaluations, IOHprofiler also allows to track the evolution of algorithm parameters, making our tool particularly useful for the analysis, comparison, and design of (self-)adaptive algorithms.

IOHprofiler is a ready-to-use software. It consists of two parts: an experimentation tool, which generates the running time data, and a post-processing part, which produces the summarizing comparisons and statistical evaluations. The experimentation part is build on the [COCO](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) software.

[This code] implements the experimentation tool of IOHprofiler. 
For the post-processing part, visit [post-processing page](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/Post-Processing).



Requirements  <a name="Requirements"></a>
------------
1. The experimentation of IOHprofiler has been test with:
  - gcc 5.4.1
  - python 2.7.12
2. For a machine running the post-processing
  - Visit [post-processing page](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/Post-Processing)


Getting Started <a name="Getting-Started"></a>
---------------
0. Check out the [_Requirements_](#Requirements) above.

1. **Download** IOHprofiler experimentation code from github [link](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/Experimentation) and unzip the `zip` file, or **type** `git clone https://github.com/IOHprofiler/Experimentation.git` (`git` needs to be installed)

2. In a system shell, **`cd` into** the `IOHprofiler` folder, 
  where the file `do.py` can be found. **execute** the following statement:
  ```
    python do.py `options`
  ```  
  Available options are:
    - `build-c` Builds the C module. Two files, IOHprofiler.c and IOHprofiler.h, will be generated at `code-experiment/build/c`
    - `run-c` Builds the C module and runs as an example some experiments in C.
    - `build-python` Builds the python module. A python package named IOHprofiler will be installed
    - `run-python` Builds the python module and runs as an example some experiments in python.
  
3. Using post-processing by visiting [post-processing page](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/Post-Processing)
